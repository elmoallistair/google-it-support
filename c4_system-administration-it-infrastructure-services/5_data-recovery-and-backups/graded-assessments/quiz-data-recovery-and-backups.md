### Question 1

What types of backup schemes are available? Check all that apply.

* **Full backup**
* **Differential backup**
* **Incremental backup**
* Partial backup

### Question 2

What are the measures included in a disaster recovery plan?

* **Preventative**
* **Detection**
* Testing
* Recovery

### Question 5

What are advantages of on-site backups? Check all that apply.

* **Data is more secure because of less outbound traffic.**
* **There is less bandwidth usage.**
* Data is safe in case of disaster.

* RAID array
