### Question 1

Nice job! ARP is used to discover what MAC address is associated with a specific IP address.

ARP stands for ______.
* Anonymous Resource Protocol
* Augmented Resolution Picture
* **Address Resolution Protocol**
* Aggressive Resource Protection 

> ARP is used to discover what MAC address is associated with a specific IP address.

### Question 1

A network device that knows how to forward data along to other networks is known as a ______.

* switch
* **hub** [INCORRECT]
* router
* server 

<br>

### Question 3

RFC stands for ______.

* Routing Frequency Control
* **Request For Comments**
* Realtime Frame Check
* Redundant Frame Controller 

> RFCs have long been used to help establish agreed-upon standards and protocols.

<br>

### Question 4

anges of IP addresses that anyone can use for their internal networks are known as ______.

* Subnet Masks
* Demarcation Points
* Autonomous Systems
* **Nonroutable Address Space**

> Non-routable address space can be used by anyone.

<br>

### Question 5

In binary, 1 +1 = _____.
* 2
* **10**
* 1
* 0 

> Binary addition is just like decimal addition, except you only have two numerals instead of ten.

<br>

### Question 6

A single octet in an IP address represents what range of decimal numbers?

* 0-250
* **0-255**
* 0-155
* 1-255 

> Eight bits of data, or a single octet, can represent all decimal numbers from 0-255.

<br>

### Question 7

What protocol communicates data between routers representing the edges of autonomous systems?

* Distance-vector
* Exterior gateway
* **Link state** [INCORRECT]
* Interior gateway 

<br>

### Question 8

How many bits long is an IP address?

* 256 bits
* 64 bits
* 8 bits
* **32 bits**

> IP addresses are 32-bit-long numbers made up of four octets, and each octet is normally described in decimal numbers.

<br>

### Question 9

Which is a valid IP address?

* 126.396.659.100
* 598.36.789
* **128.42.64.78**
* A8:97:4F:6D:H6:0F 

> 128.42.64.78 has the correct notation and does not containany numbers that can't be represented by a single octet.

<br>

### Question 10

Which IP address is Class C?

* 224.24.45.69
* 128.42.39.72
* 132.26.144.52
* **192.37.48.98**

> Class C addresses begin with a first octet value of 192 through 223.

<br>

### Question 11

What protocol is used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address?

* Subnet mask
* **ARP table**
* SQL database
* CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing 

> An ARP table is just a list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them.

<br>

### Question 12

What is the process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks called?

* Cloud computing
* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
* Clustering
* **Subnetting**

> Subnetting is the process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets.

<br>

### Question 13

What is the maximum decimal number possible to represent with 16 bits?

* **65536**
* 256
* 1600
* 16 

> If you have a 16-bit number, you can just perform the math 2^16 which would be 65536 numbers.

<br>

### Question 14

Computer A wants to send some data to computer B. Computer A knows that Computer B is not on its local network, so it sends the packet to the router between Network A and Network B. Based on how many network hops have happened, how much will the TTL field be decremented by?

* 2
* 6
* **1** [INCORRECT]
* 8 

<br>

### Question 15

What type of network address space allows for nodes on a network to communicate with each other, but prevents any gateway router from forwarding traffic there, and are reserved for internal networks?

* MAC address
* IP address
* Subnet mask
* **Non-routable address space**

> Non-routable address space allows for nodes on such a network to communicate with each other, but no gateway router will attempt to forward traffic to this type of network.
