## Symmetric Encryption

<br>

### Question 1

What are the components that make up a cryptosystem? Check all that apply.

* **Decryption algorithms**
* **Encryption algorithms**
* Transmission algorithms
* **Key generation algorithms**

> A cryptosystem is a collection of algorithms needed to operate an encryption service. This involves generating encryption keys, as well as encryption and decryption operations.

<br>

### Question 2

What is steganography?

* The study of languages
* The practice of encoding messages
* The study of stegosauruses
* **The practice of hiding messages**

> Steganography involves hiding messages, but not encoding them.

<br>

### Question 3

What makes an encryption algorithm symmetric?

* High speed
* Different keys used for encryption and decryption
* **The same keys used for encryption and decryption**
* Very large key sizes

> The symmetry of a symmetric algorithm refers to one key being used for both encryption and decryption.

<br>

### Question 4

What's the difference between a stream cipher and a block cipher?

* Block ciphers are only used for block device encryption.
* Stream ciphers can't save encrypted data to disk.
* **Stream ciphers encrypt data as a continuous stream, while block ciphers operate on chunks of data.**
* There is no difference.

> A stream cipher takes data in as a continuous stream, and outputs the ciphertext as a continuous stream, too. A block cipher encrypts the data in chunks, or blocks.

### Question 5

True or false: The smaller the encryption key is, the more secure the encrypted data is.

* TRUE
* **FALSE**

> The reverse is true. The larger the key, the more secure the encrypted data will be.
